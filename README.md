2. [SQL](https://github.com/KachiiC/Koa_tutorial/tree/master/Parts/2%20-%20SqlServer) - We will create a SQL database for our Koa server using postgres and sequelize.
3. MongoDb - We will create a non-relational database using mongoose and mongodb. 
4. Deployment - We will deploy the Koa server you've made to online using heroku!
